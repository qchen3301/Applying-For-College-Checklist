# COLLEGE CHECKLIST - A FULL MERN STACK APP ON TWO MODELS

### OVERVIEW
---
This app was designed with my younger sister in mind. She will be applying to college soon and I wanted to be able to help her keep track of the tedious paperwork that comes with applying to higher education. 

### Goals Reached
---
* CRUD on two models
* Two working schemas
* Full stack development process in vanilla React.js
* Semi-behavioral relevance
* API built
* Live deployment to Heroku
* CSS styling with vanilla React.js (with libraries)

### Goals Iceboxed
---
* A many-to-many reference relationship with a third model
* Full behavioral relevance
* User validation on forms
* One error prevents fully RESTFUL routing on Heroku live site
* DRY-er code
* Transitional animation
* Navbar
